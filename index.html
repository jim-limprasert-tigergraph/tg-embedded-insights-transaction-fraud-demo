            <h2>Investigative Widgets</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of these widgets seen below is to provide a way for investigators
                to look into the data and gain some insights. These are just small number of widgets we have from
                the total number of widgets in the Transaction Fraud solution kit, arranged for the purpose of a demo.
            </p>

            <h3>Merchant Network Pagerank</h3>
            <p>
                This widget shows the top 5 merchants with the highest pagerank score and the fraud transactions associated with them.
                The PageRank algorithm, originally developed by Google to rank web pages, can also be adapted to analyze and identify the influence of merchants for transaction data. 
                The principles of PageRank, which measure the importance or influence of a node based on the quantity and quality of connections it has, can be applied to assess the influence of merchants.
                Merchants with a higher influence score are considered more influential within the network, indicating that they have a greater impact on the overall flow of transactions in the network.
                It's possible to identify merchants that play a significant role in facilitating transactions within the network. These influential merchants may have a large number of connections to other merchants or high-value transactions.

                <br>
                <br>

                Based on the graph below, we can see that merchants like "fraud_Dickinson Ltd" and "fraud_Boyer PLC" were one of the most influential merchants (Note: all merchants have
                "fraud_" prefix in front of them in this dataset).
                We not only show the merchants that have the most influence based on the PageRank algorithm, but we also show the fraud transactions linked with those merchants too.

            <h3>Analyzing Shortest Path to Fraud Transaction</h3>
            <p>
                One main benefit of a graph database is the ability to quickly find connections from one path to another.
                By finding the shortest paths from a transaction to a fraud transaction, we can see how the fraudulent transactions
                are linked to other transactions (could be a non-fraudulent transaction).

                This widget is interactive. Vertices in this widget can be dragged around. You can also double-click on the vertex to expand towards other vertices as well, to see
                additional connections from those vertices.

            <h3>Getting Top Credit cards based on total transaction amount or Number of Transactions.</h3>
            <p>
                These two tables show the top credit cards based on the total transaction amounts that are made on those
                credit cards and the total transaction numbers linked to it.
                
                Unusually high total transaction amount or transaction number can be something to look out for, as those
                can be interpreted as a sign that a credit card is involved in a fraudulent transaction.
            </p>

            <h3>Live Fraud Rate</h3>
            <p>
                This pie chart shows the live fraud rate. We can observe that around 1% of the transactions were fraud.

            <h3>Merchant Fraud Purchase Category</h3>
            <p>
                Knowing the merchant categories with the highest fraud amount is crucial for several reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Understanding high-risk categories enables businesses to assess their exposure to fraud effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Armed with this knowledge, organizations can allocate resources more effectively towards fraud prevention measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Fraud Prevention Strategies:</strong> It facilitates the development of tailored strategies to combat fraud in specific merchant categories.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer Protection:</strong> Proactive measures in high-fraud categories help preserve customer trust and loyalty.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Businesses can ensure compliance with regulations by focusing efforts on high-risk categories as required by law.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Based on the results, we can see that the transactions related to merchant shopping category has the highest amount of fraud associated with it.

            <h3>Top Fraudulent Activity Card</h3>
            <p>
                This table shows cards with at least one transaction fraud linked to it.
                This allows you to see which card is associated with fraud more.
                Fraud amount here ranges from lower than 50 dollars to more than 13000 dollars.

                <br>

            <h3>Net Benefit of Using a Graph Database</h3>
            <p>
                This widget shows the net benefit in estimated revenue gain of using a graph database for catching fraudulent transactions.
                The net benefit is based on the estimated number of fraud that can be caught when graph features are used in the Machine Learning XGBoost model.
                There were around 860000 transactions in this sample dataset. With more transactions and real data, the expected revenue realized from using a TigerGraphToken
                graph database should increase.
            </p>

            <h3>Fraud Related Losses</h3>
                <div id="fraud-related-loss-block">
                    <p>
                        This figure belows shows the estimated fraud related losses for two cases: when graph features from TigerGraph is used,
                        and when the graph features are not used. When TigerGraph is used, there are a noticeable lower amount of missed fraud and lower amount of
                        blocked transactions that are legitimate (but detected as a fraud).

                        <br>

                        These are just a few of the types of widgets available from TigerGraph Insights page. There are more widget types,
                        like Map, Line Chart, and Sankey diagram to be used to gain more insights from TigerGraph graph database!
